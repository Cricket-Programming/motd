Hello everyone, Cricket here. I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone in the community for your dedication and support over these years. However, the time has come for me to step away from Capuchin Caverns. If anyone is interested in taking over ownership, please reach out at capuchincaverns@gmail.com. Enjoy the new update, and thank you for being part of this journey!
â€” Cricket (Founder)
